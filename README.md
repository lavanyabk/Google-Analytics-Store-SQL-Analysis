Kaggle Project: Predict how much GStore customers will spend (https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction/data)
This data set is included in a Kaggle competition wherein youâ€™re challenged to analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. Hopefully, the outcome will be more actionable operational changes and a better use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data. 
I worked on this dataset for my Database Foundations class.
